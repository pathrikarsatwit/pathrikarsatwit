## 🎓 Master’s Thesis

### 🔎 RAG System with Attack Simulation

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using vector embeddings and semantic search to generate context-aware answers from a document corpus.

It also explores security vulnerabilities by simulating:

* Document Injection Attacks
* Retrieval Poisoning Attacks

The system compares outputs before and after attacks to demonstrate how adversarial manipulation can affect LLM responses.

Built with Python, FAISS, and Sentence Transformers.
