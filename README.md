🎓 Master’s Thesis
🔎 RAG System with Attack Simulation

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using vector embeddings and semantic search to generate context-aware answers from a document corpus.

It also explores security vulnerabilities in RAG systems by simulating:

Document Injection Attacks

Retrieval Poisoning Attacks

The system compares outputs before and after attacks to demonstrate how adversarial manipulation can affect LLM responses.

Built with Python, FAISS, and Sentence Transformers.

🚀 Completed Projects
✈️ Vacation Genie – AI Travel Concierge

A full-stack AI travel planning system integrating a fine-tuned LLaMA model with real-time API data.
